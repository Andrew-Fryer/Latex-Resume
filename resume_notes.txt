CV
    longer
    chronological
    more standard format

maybe I should put my address on there...

work experience
    list impact I had (not the responsibility I had)

Skills
    list technical skills only
        soft skills (such as leadership) should be evident from my work experience section
    only list things I'd be comfortable answers questions about in an interview
    denote competency in skill "Java - Advanced"/Intermediate/Basic

<verb (achieved, improved, trained, resolved, launched, built)> <noun> from <data> (which led/in order) to <impact (ideally with numbers)>

write an objective at the top of the resume until I have enough experience to write a summary

after I've graduated, I should remove my graduation date from my resume
