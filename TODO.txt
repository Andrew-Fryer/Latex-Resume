This is a list of known problems with my resume:
-links don't look clickable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-more #s according to Andy Tran and Kyle Meade

Feedback from Andy Tran:
Text looks a bit small to read
Need more spacing between roles -> white space is key!
Education - pick 3 courses, add grades (GPA 4.0/4.3)
Work experience - reverse chronological order!
DCP -> can you talk about any results? Did the boot loading solution save time?
Betalab -> can you talk about any results? Number of users?
TA -> how many people?


CEC second time?


Use the words:
 Python, Go, C++, JavaScript
network protocols, secure network design, web application/browser security, authentication control, applied cryptography/security protocols, intrusion detection

Excellent communication skills
^I can put those in:
ELEC 473
consulting I did software development lifecycle and applied security protocol and communication skills


too many words
position should be easier to read (not sure if I'll take the time to fix this)
"Extracurricular Activities" -> "Extracurricular Competitions"/"Competitions"

make font bigger if I can 
    I made it 12 I think
add skills in relevant experience and bold them
  I think I should spread them out over different experiences???

new profile picture on LinkedIn!

say "agile" exactly once?
spread out bolded skills?
