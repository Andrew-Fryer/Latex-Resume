This is a list of known problems with my resume:
-links don't look clickable
-I should bold important stuff
-more #s according to Andy Tran and Kyle Meade

Feedback from Andy Tran:
Text looks a bit small to read
Need more spacing between roles -> white space is key!
Education - pick 3 courses, add grades (GPA 4.0/4.3)
Work experience - reverse chronological order!
DCP -> can you talk about any results? Did the boot loading solution save time?
Betalab -> can you talk about any results? Number of users?
Vena: consider keeping only the last 2 lines
FLAP -> reword to monthly active users (MAU)
TA -> how many people?
Unpaid experience -> rename to extra-curricular experience
